Code/PR review checkpoints
- Dead Code, unused variables/imports/parameters
- Function design: naming accuracy, Single responsibility
- Performance
- Type Safety
- Error Handling
- Code Structure & Maintainability
- Testing & Quality Assurance
- Security Considerations
- Library/Dependency Upgrades - Deep Interface Analysis
    - When libraries upgrade (especially major versions), check for interface changes
    - Search for obsolete methods that may still exist but are no longer called by the library
    - Verify all interface implementations match new version requirements
    - Look for breaking changes in method signatures, return types, or behavior
    - Use targeted searches: `grep -r "OldMethodName" .` for known changed methods
    - Compile success â‰  functional correctness with interface changes
- Unit test is well covered, edge cases are tested
    - run unit test for changed code
- write the meaningful log message.
    - Always log some variable, not just a hardcoded string
- comments should be meaningful and up-to-date
- meaningful naming, include variables and function names
- SOPS encrypted files should decrypt and check the content
    - ask me to provide the STS token
- list the enhancement, how to make it better
    - better commits, logs...
